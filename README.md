# SongBirdz Back-End

This project contains the back-end for the [SongBirdz NFT collection](https://songbirdz.cc). It includes the solidity contract, test code for that contract, a NodeJS server to serve images, metadata, and merkle proofs, as well as the scripts used to generate and deploy the collection.

You can find the front-end application [here](https://github.com/dry-tortuga/songbirdz-collection-frontend).

**NOTE:** The `./private` folder is not included in this repo, which contains the species names, images, audio files, and merkle trees for all 10 flocks in the collection... so you will need to generate it yourself if forking this repo!

# Solidity (ERC721 Contract)

The [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) configuration for all contracts is in the `./hardhat.config.js` file.

**NPM commands:**
- `npm run compile-contracts` - compiles all contracts.
- `npm run test-contracts` - tests all contracts.
- `npm run start-blockchain` - starts a local blockchain for testing.
- `npm run verify-testnet` - verifies a deployed ERC721 contract on testnet.
- `npm run verify-mainnet` - verifies a deployed ERC721 contract on mainnet.

## SongBirdz.sol - 10k NFT Collection

The ERC721 contract for the SongBirdz NFT collection is in the `./contracts/SongBirdz.sol` file.

# NodeJS (Server)

The `./server` folder contains all logic related to the back-end server which is used to serve images, audio files, metadata, and merkle proofs for the NFT collection.

Since each bird starts out unidentified, this back-end server is used to obfuscate the species name  associated with each bird until it has been successfully identified. Once all 10,000 birds are identified, the back-end server will be shut-down in favor of a decentralized solution.

It uses the OpenSea Streaming SDK to listen for ERC-721 transfer and sale events in real-time and award points to the user, as needed.

**API endpoints:**

- `GET /birds/image/:id` -> Returns the image file associated with the given bird ID.
- `GET /birds/metadata/:id` -> Returns the metadata associated with the given bird ID. If the bird is not yet identified, then the species name and description will be hidden. See [here](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/getting-started) for the expected JSON structure of the response.
- `GET /birds/merkle-proof/:id` -> Returns the merkle tree proof associated with the given bird ID and species name guess.
- `GET /birds/already-identified-list` -> Returns a list of bird IDs that have already been identified.
- `GET /birds/random-bird` -> Returns a random bird ID that is not yet identified.
- `GET /birds/points/leaderboard` -> Returns the points leaderboard for a specific season.
- `GET /birds/life-list/leaderboard` -> Returns the life list leaderboard across all seasons.
- `GET /birds/life-list/data` -> Returns the life list data for a specific user.
- `GET /birds/daily-streaks/active` -> Returns the daily streak leaderboard.
- `GET /birds/daily-streak` -> Returns the daily streak for a specific user.
- `POST /birds/daily-streak` -> Updates the daily streak for a specific user.
- `GET /birds/memory-match/leaderboard` -> Returns the leaderboard for the memory match game.
- `GET /birds/memory-match/games-played` -> Returns the games played (today) for a specific user for the memory match game.
- `POST /birds/memory-match/log` -> Stores the result of a memory match game for a specific user.

**Node scripts:**
- `./scripts/node/backfillBonusPoints.js` - backfills bonus points data based on offchain activities such as user activity on Twitter, Telegram, and Farcaster.
- `./scripts/node/backfillSpeciesPoints.js` - backfills points data based on ERC-721 transfer and sale events, using the OpenSea and Alchemy SDKs.
- `./scripts/node/generateImages.js` - generates the image files using Dalle-3 for a flock of 1000 birds.
- `./scripts/node/generateMerkleTree.js` - generates the merkle tree for a flock of 1000 birds.
- `./scripts/node/generateSpeciesAndAudio.js` - generates the species names, answer choices, and audio files for a flock of 1000 birds.
- `./scripts/node/refreshCacheOpensea.js` - refreshes the cached metadata for all 10,000 birds on OpenSea.
- `./scripts/node/regenerateAudio.js` - regenerates the audio files for a subset of the birds in a given flock.

**Bash scripts:**
- `./scripts/bash/backfillCache` - refreshes the server cache with up-to-date identification status for the 10,000 birds.
- `./scripts/bash/processImageFilesXXX` - converts the final image files from webp to jpg (256/768) for the 10,000 birds.
- `./scripts/bash/trimAudioFiles` - cleans up the final audio files for the 10,000 birds.

## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Node.js installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Node.js version >= 22.0.0 required)

2. Clone this repository

3. Navigate into the project directory

	```bash
	$ cd songbirdz-collection-backend
	```

4. Install the requirements

	```bash
	$ npm install
	$ npx api install "@opensea/v2.0#tyjem2mlwzlfgof"
	```

5. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

	On Linux systems:
	```bash
	$ cp .env.example .env.development
	```
	On Windows:
	```powershell
	$ copy .env.example .env.development
	```

6. Add your API keys, contract address, and wallet data to the newly created `.env.development` file

7. Start the blockchain on your local machine at http://localhost:8545

	```bash
	$ npm run start-blockchain
	```

8. Deploy the contract on your local machine to `0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3`

	```bash
	$ npm run deploy-local
	```

9. Populate the NFT collection in the contract on your local machine

	```bash
	$ npm run populate-local
	```

10. Start the server on your local machine at http://localhost:3080

	```bash
	$ npm run start-server
	```

You should now be able to succesfully make API requests to the back-end server and run the front-end application!
