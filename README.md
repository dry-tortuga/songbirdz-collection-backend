# SongBirdz Back-End

This project contains the back-end for the [SongBirdz NFT collection](https://songbirdz.cc). It includes the solidity contract, test code for that contract, a NodeJS server to serve images, metadata, and merkle proof, as well as the scripts used to generate and deploy the collection.

You can find the front-end application [here](https://github.com/dry-tortuga/songbirdz-collection-frontend).

**NOTE:** The species names and merkle trees are hidden for now until each bird in the NFT collection has been successfully identified. This means the `./private` folder is not included in this repo, so you will need to generate it yourself if forking this repo!

# Solidity (ERC721 Contract)

The ERC721 contract for the SongBirdz NFT collection is in the `./contracts/SongBirdz.sol` file.

Test code for the contract is in the `./test/SongBirdz.js` file.

Hardhat configuration for the contract is in the `./hardhat.config.js` file.

There are 2 scripts related to the ERC721 contract:

1. `./scripts/solidity/deployContract.js` can be used to deploy the ERC721 contract to the local, test, and production environments.

2. `./scripts/solidity/populateCollection.js` can be used to populate the NFT collection once the ERC721 contract has been deployed to the local, test, and production environments.

There are npm commands related to the ERC721 contract:

1. `npm run compile-contracts` can be used to compile the ERC721 contract.

2. `npm run test-contracts` can be used to test the ERC721 contract.

# NodeJS (Server)

The `./server` folder contains all logic related to the back-end server which is used to serve images, metadata, and merkle proofs for the NFT collection.

Since each bird starts out unidentified, this back-end server is used to obfuscate the species name and image file associated with each bird until they've all been successfully identified. At that point in time, the back-end server will be shut-down and all species names, image data, and merkle trees will be moved to the front-end... and then eventually stored in a decentralized provider such as [nft.storage](https://nft.storage/).

The API endpoints for the server are:

- `GET /birds/image/:id` -> Returns the image file associated with the given bird ID.

- `GET /birds/metadata/:id` -> Returns the metadata associated with the given bird ID. If the bird is not yet identified, then the species name and description will be hidden. See [here](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/getting-started) for the expected JSON structure of the response.

- `GET /birds/merkle-proof/:id` -> Returns the merkle tree proof associated with the given bird ID and species name guess.

There are 4 node scripts related to the server:

1. `./scripts/node/generateImages.js` can be used to generate the image files using Dalle-3 for a collection of 1000 birds.

2. `./scripts/node/generateSpeciesAndAudio.js` can be used to generate the species names, answer choices, and audio files for a collection of 1000 birds.

3. `./scripts/node/generateMerkleTree.js` can be used to generate the merkle tree for a collection of 1000 birds.

4. `./scripts/node/backfillPoints.js` can be used to backfill any missing points based on transfer and sale events on OpenSea.

- `npx api install "@opensea/v2.0#tyjem2mlwzlfgof"`

There are 2 bash scripts related to the server:

1. `./scripts/bash/trimAudioFiles` can be used to clean up the final audio files for a collection of 1000 birds.

2. `./scripts/bash/processImageFilesXXX` can be used to clean up the final image files for a collection of 1000 birds.

## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Node.js installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Node.js version >= 16.18.0 required)

2. Clone this repository

3. Navigate into the project directory

	```bash
	$ cd songbirdz-collection-backend
	```

4. Install the requirements

	```bash
	$ npm install
	```

5. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

	On Linux systems:
	```bash
	$ cp .env.example .env.development
	```
	On Windows:
	```powershell
	$ copy .env.example .env.development
	```

6. Add your API keys, contract address, and wallet data to the newly created `.env.development` file

7. Start the blockchain on your local machine at http://localhost:8545

	```bash
	$ npm run start-blockchain
	```

8. Deploy the contract on your local machine at 0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3

	```bash
	$ npm run deploy-local
	```

9. Populate the NFT collection in the contract on your local machine

	```bash
	$ npm run populate-local
	```

10. Start the server on your local machine at http://localhost:3080

	```bash
	$ npm run start-server
	```

You should now be able to succesfully run the front-end application!
